#+TITLE: learn to run pg_dump & aws s3 cp on lambda
#+DESCRIPTION: dump pg data and push to s3
#+DATE: Thursday, Aug 01 2019


* Summary

  With this repo, I learned:
  - layers on lambda, versioning them
  - how to get custom runtime over lambda working
  - blend all free stuffs on internet to play along
  - storage classes on S3, [[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4][pricing]]
** Arch

   - [ lambda ] 
     - *layer1*: pg_dump runner (I named bash-runner, don't know why)
     - *layer2*: awscli
     - *script*: ~[[./main.sh][main.sh~]] with handler function calling other dependent functions
     - *env*: [[./.env][~.env]]~ file housing the secrets, I didn't know lambda also provides place to put env vars #reviselater

   - pg_dump <-- [pg@play-with-docker]:5432 via ngrok
     1. aws s3 cp dump.sql -> s3 bucket
** Step for reproduction
   #+begin_quote
   you have been warned, please try this at home ;)
   #+end_quote
   If you wanna do stupid thing like me here are you steps of reproduction:
   1. Preparation:
      1. get [[http://bit.ly/geneseacademy][free]] aws account by filling form at end
      2. get a pg running available public to world ( I am not doing lambda in vpc for now) some how, I will write about it if necessary.
       I managed to do it with [[http://play-with-docker.com][Play with docker]] + [[https://ngrok.com/download][ngrok]] fusion
      3. configure things needed for lambda {iam role}, & s3 bucket(create new if necessary, and allow lambda role to write to it).
       For sake of simplicity, I gave full control for time being. (+lambda full, and s3fullaccess+)
   2. Execution:
      1. create a lambda layers
         1. layer for pg_dump
         2. layer for awscli
